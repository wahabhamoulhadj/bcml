# JITBoost: An Enhanced Approach to Just-In-Time Defect Prediction

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

"JITBoost" stands at the intersection of artificial intelligence and software defect prediction. In an era dominated by expansive software architectures, our initiative introduces an ensemble approach by integrating Boolean Combination Algorithms (BCAs) with traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. This amalgamation aims to refine the accuracy and efficiency of defect prediction within vast execution traces.

## ðŸš€ Problem Overview

The ever-growing complexity of software systems brings forth enormous execution traces, making the early identification of software anomalies paramount. Our solution leverages ensemble techniques, combining the strengths of multiple classifiers to address this challenge head-on.
